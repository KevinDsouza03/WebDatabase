            Elephants are extraordinary creatures that captivate me with their intelligence, 
            social bonds, and gentle nature despite their massive size. These magnificent animals 
            are known for their complex emotions and remarkable memory, making them one of the 
            most fascinating species on Earth.

        <h2>Fun Facts About Elephants</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Elephants are the only mammals that can't jump, but they can use their trunks 
                like a snorkel and swim for long distances in deep water.</li>
            <li>An elephant's trunk has about 40,000 muscles and can lift up to 700 pounds, 
                yet is gentle enough to pick up a single blade of grass.</li>
            <li>Baby elephants suck their trunks for comfort, just like human babies suck 
                their thumbs, and it takes them several months to gain full control of 
                their trunks.</li>
        </ul>
